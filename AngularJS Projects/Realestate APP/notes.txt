Angular.js notes
--bootstrap is the way we 

angular.module references a thrid party dependiency to pull into the application such as bootstrap

after you type this into app you type in ng-app="APPNAME" into body tag

anything in the tags are part of the apps 
--------------------------------------------

model - view - controller MVC
model = database communication
view = view
controller - ties between model and view

Angular takes MVC approach BUT

model: property of scope
view: html template
Controller: business logic

Scope = ties the controller and view together
properties and functions

concepts:
has two way data bining - single source of truth - changes reflected automaticlly, App data stays in syn


depency injection is allows use to get another piece of code and pass it in to another function kind of paramaters




You can apply a filter by using

| FILTER PROPERTY

Basic json Data
$scope.myData = [
         
         {
             "type": "Condo",
             "Price": 22000,
             "Address": "213 Grove Street",
             "Description": "Excellent place, really nice view!"
         },
         {
             "type": "Duplex",
             "Price": 39500,
             "Address": "834 River Lane",
             "Description": "Great neighbood and lots of nice green space"
         }
     ];
        
        
        
    });



with filter ng-repeat will repeat for each
curreny is a filter that shows prices

https 
- post, post, get put, delete common http verbs





---------- Creating the new interface

ng-click = function() = make sure to tie this function to scope

conditional div/tag 
ng-show="showMessage == true"   = show based of condition


allows a toggle     
<button ng-click="showMessage = true">Toogle message</button>

vs assigning
     <button ng-click="showMessage = !showMessage">Toogle message</button>


<input type="text" placeholder="Leave a message" ng-model="message"><br>
        {{message}}

ng-model shows text as you go


ng-src = make sure source is include d
