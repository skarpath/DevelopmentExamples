Module can have something called a config 
a config can have something called a route 

The routes can track which page their on by 2 types
- Views
- Controller

The scrope helps bind the view and controller togther
now the controller has something called a factory underneath it to perform crud/services DATA

views have directives SO look like this

- Module
- Config
- Routes
	- Views             <SCOPE>   - CONTROLLER
	   ^ Directives						^ Factory (data)

NOW modules are containers

Modules/apps have ( THINK of this like as the appliction and everthing under as the pieces)
- config
	- routes
- filter
- directive
- factory
	- service
	- Provider
	- Value
- Controller


---- now to create a module you go. Array is used for dependency modules are modules you wish to use 
var demoApp = angular.modules('demoAPP', []);

--Creating a controller in a module

var demoApp = angular.module('demoApp', []);

demoApp.controller('simpleController', function ($scope) {
	$scope.customers = [
		{ name: 'Dave Jones', city: 'Phoenix'},
		{ name: 'Dave Jones2', city: 'Phoenix2'}
	];
}
