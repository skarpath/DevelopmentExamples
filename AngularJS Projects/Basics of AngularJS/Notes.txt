03- using an angular JS filters can filter data

to do this in the data-ng-repeat directive you put in filers
 
such as "cust in customers | filter:name "
this filters by name of person from input name directive

to filter orderby You can go orderBy: 'city'

Now to display them as uppercase/lower case 
When you print them out by the databinding you add | uppercase
{{ cust.name | uppercase}}

04- Views, Controllers, and scope

Controller will handel which data get served or uses what service
- Scope handels all tying in beween view between controller

view model is the data bween the view and the controller


$scope will inject a scope object that will serve as a source for the data.

then use data-ng-controller in a dev to call the controller and will only last withing the div container

NOTE THE controller will only last for the duration of where you placed it.

<div>controller</div> VS { <div>controller<div> 100 lines of code</div></div> }
